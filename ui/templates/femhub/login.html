<div class="femhub-login-text">
    The goal of the FEMhub Online Lab is to make scientific computing
    accessible to anyone. No need to own a strong computer or buy
    expensive software. Everything takes place inside the web browser
    window, that turns into a virtual computer desktop. The Online Lab
    is accessible from PCs, laptops, netbooks, iPads, PDAs, and even
    web-enabled smart phones. The Online Lab is powered by computers
    of the <a href="http://hpfem.org">hp-FEM group</a> at the
    <a href="http://www.unr.edu/"> University of Nevada, Reno</a>.
